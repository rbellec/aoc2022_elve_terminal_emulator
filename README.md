# Aoc2022 Elves Terminal Emulator

In case you fell of the bridge and have access to this repo, please use it to contact the elves !

This emulator may even help you debug the elve code (we never know what waits for us next !) by running is clock tick by clock tick.

Note : I did not do TUI nor use Curses for ~20 years and started again yesterday for fun (see https://github.com/rbellec/ruby_curses_forest_demo), any feedback is welcome !
