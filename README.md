Run with the example data set if no file is provided

This emulator may even help you debug the elve code (we never know what waits for us next !) by running is clock tick by clock tick.

Note : I did not do TUI nor use Curses for ~20 years and started again yesterday for fun (see https://github.com/rbellec/ruby_curses_forest_demo), any feedback is welcome !
